This release is still preview version. Substantial update is still planned.MATLAB functions of this package are compatible with GNU Octave 4.0.2 except GUI related ones.Please note that execution time using Octave is about three times longer than MATLAB and it requires signal package.Note (06/Oct./2015):STRAIGHT and its GUIs are compatible with Matlab R2015b. This release is still preview version. Substantial update is planned.Matlab audio IO functions are substantially updated and "wavread" and "wavwrite" are no longer supported in the latest release (R2015b). This version replaces them with their new counterparts. Matlab update on graphics functions also introduced annyoing difficulties. They are also fixed in this release for Note: old morphing functions are not reviesed yet.Note (22/Nov./2013):This version is compatible with a new morphing framework (Temporally variable multi-aspect arbitrary many voices morphing). Because this new framwork is not stable, the new morphing procedures are stored in a separate directory and archived in a different file.Installation:Please set mathab path to the directory where provided m-files are stored.Test:(1) STRAIGHT:Please type the following command:TandemSTRAIGHThandlerThen, using the dialog popped out, select a test speech file you like to read.(2) MorphingPlease type the following command:MorphingMenuThen, read speech files to be morphed using the menu button.(3) Running TANDEM-STRAIGHT using Matlab commands:Please execute the following script using the 'cell mode'exampleScriptForAnalysisAndSynthesis.mDocument:Please use my APSIPA2009 article for getting start with.http://www.apsipa.org/proceedings_2009/pdf/MP-SS1-1.pdfSite:Update information can be found in the following page:http://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/tSTRAIGHT/TANDEM-STRAIGHTwithGUI.html- --------No warranty:This package is provided as is.

It also consists of a fragment of a new framework for synthinthesis. Unfortunately, this new framwork is not integrated in morphing procedures. Please use this at your own risk.15/Dec./2012 morphing and F0 extraction bugs are fixed.17/Aug./2012 safe guards are added on auto tracking, (check variables:  voicedMargin, sourceMargin)03/Aug./2012 bug fix in generateMorphedSpeechNewAP, line 62							buf fix in exTandemSTRAIGHTsynthNx, line 17426/June/2012 bug fix in generateMorphedSpeechNewAP, 11 lines from line 11221/June/2012 bug fix in vuv morphing in generateMorphedSpeechNewAP, line 68
